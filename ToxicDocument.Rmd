library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tm)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(SnowballC)

# Loading training data
df_train <- read.csv("data/train.csv", sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = F)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
